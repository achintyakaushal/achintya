        <h1>Hobbies in detail</h1>
        <strong>cricket:</strong>
        <p>cricket has always been very close to my heart. i always wanted to be a cricketer but in life,u don't always get what u want</p>
        <p>and with me,getting what i really want ,is a tough deal to crack. i couldn't pursue cricket since we belonged to an</p>
        <p>average middle class indian family and we couldn't afford it. cricket is something that will always stay with me</p>
        <p>i don't know if i play good or bad,but as far as i remember,it is one of the oldest skills i learned</p>
        <p>my heart pains every day that i could not pursue cricket in life,but then there was hardly anything i could do</p>
        <strong>rap</strong>
        <p>rap songs make me forget all my worries and anxieties. even though we are in the 21t century,obody gives a damn </p>
        <p>about someone's mental health,same is the case with me.But rap helps me to overcome these struggles.the stories</p>
        <p>of indian rappers and even hollywood rappers like eminem,make me feel that one day the sun will shine, My favourite</p>
        <p>rap song is "3AM" by Russ and "Stronger" and "king" by bazanji</p>
        <strong>bgmi</strong>
        <p>i never made it to physical sports team of india,but i play bgmi cause i hope one day i can represnt my country in esports</p>
        <p>if i have the potential and skills. i am not that much focussed on it,but i somewhere in the back of my mind ,hope to make this work</p>
